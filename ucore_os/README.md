labs info
----------------
```
lab0: preparing
lab1: boot/protect mode/stack/interrupt
lab2: physical memory management
lab3: virtual memory management
lab4: kernel thread management
lab5: user process management
lab6: scheduling
lab7: mutex/sync
lab8: filesystem
```

TESTED ENVIRONMENT
==================
```
UBUNTU 16.04 x86-64: GCC-7.3 
UBUNTU 14.04+: GCC-4.8.2+ CLANG-3.5+
FEDORA 20+: GCC-4.8.2+
```

EXERCISE STEPS
==============
```
0 Get the newest os lab src code/docs.(Insure you can connect to github in ubuntu running on VrtualBox)
0.1 If you try to get all code
  $rm -rf ucore_lab
  $git clone git://github.com/chyyuu/ucore_os_lab.git
  $cd ucore_lab
0.2 If you cloned ucore_lab and only try to get the updated code
  $cd ucore_os_lab
  $git pull
1 $cd labX  
2 read code (specially the modified or added files)
3 add your code
4 compile your code
  $make
5 check your code
  $make qemu
OR
  $make grade

6 debug your code
  $make debug

7 handin your code
  $make handin
```

OPTION
==============
Now, ucore suuport LLVM/Clang-3.5 + 
in step4:
  $ USELLVM=1 make
then you will use clang to compile ucore

GRADE/RANK
==========
```
Superman: Finish all OS labs in one month by yourself
Master: Finish all OS labs in two month by yourself
Veteran: Finish all OS labs in three month by yourself
Apprentice: Finish all OS labs in one semester with other guy's help
```

RESOURCE REPOSITORY
===================
```

Join us, OS research group in Tsinghua Univ.
============================================
If you are interested in OS Research/Development, we welcome you to joining our OS research group:
- OS performance improvement for multicore architecture
- fuzzing/symbolic execution technologies on OS for finding kernel bugs
- improving performance and reliability on OS subsystem, such as device driver
- design OS specification and build correct OS
- OS & CPU(such as RISC-V）codesign
- other topics about OS

Just like [other great OS researchs ](https://github.com/chyyuu/aos_course/blob/master/readinglist.md)
